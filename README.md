# Widoco Ontology Site Example

Example repository demonstrating use of
[Widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) for publishing the TROV ontology. (Widoco
is based on LODE, which we've used for other projects through pyLODE.) See
[ROAR](https://leonvanwissen.nl/vocab/roar/docs/) for a simple example.
